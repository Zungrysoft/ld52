* assets object
  in the assets file
  define source files in code, assets are loaded into the file on game startup before the "Start game" button appears
  once a path is defined in e.g. "soundSources.win = blah", you can access the sound in-game with "assets.sounds.win"
  "imageSources" are converted into both "images" and "textures" to be used with webgl

* game.s
  game.js updates at exactly 60hz
  game.js draws as much as it can, but no more than 60fps (as that would be unnecessary)
  game.js exports ctx, the 2d canvas context used for drawing

* scene
  given a scene .ldtk file in constructor
  represents current game scene, containing level data and currently alive things

* things
  everything in the game extends from the Thing class
  everything in a scene is a Thing with "update" and "draw" functions

  a Thing has a position and speed vector, and integrates its speed into its position every frame
  Things can collide with other Things that have "isSolid" enabled
  Things can collide with tiles in the scene's map that are listed in the tiles property of the Thing's "collisionSettings" object
  Things can animate based on animations
